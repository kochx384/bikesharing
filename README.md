# NYC CitiBike Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze New York City bike sharing data to understand how bike sharing works and to see how it can be applied to a possible new bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Using Tableau, we can create visualizations of the data that are easy to understand and can be shown to possible future investors.

Again, this shows that the highest number of bikes are rented by male users. This also shows again that the peak times for both male and female users is before and after work hours.

The highest number of users are subscribers to the bike sharing service, they rent the bikes multiple times.

## Summary
The highest number of users are subscribers who use the bikes to commute to and from work. As for the gender breakdown, male users use the bikes a lot more than female users. However, both genders follow the same trends of using the bikes the most before and after work during the week. 
An additional visualization I would do is a heatmap that shows the number of trips per weekday per hour by age ranges. Another visualization I would do is a heatmap that shows the number of trips per weekday per hour by the typer of users, annual subscribers versus short-term customers.
